<u><b><i>After School Trips (Monday-Friday):</b></i></u><br>
Depart from the high school gym after <br>school. Equipment may be delivered <br>
before school (7:00 am - 7:30 am) to<br> the KHS gym or after school to the bus.<br>
<b>Do not deliver equipment to a school<br> office of during the school day.</b> <br>
Weekend/Day trips will leave and return<br> to the high school parking lot unless<br> otherwise directed.
<p>
<u><b><i>Trip Cancellations:</b></i></u><br>
If a trip is cancelled, pick up your check <br>in H326 (Mr.Brumbaugh).  
These <br>payments <b>will not</b> be credited to <br>future trips.  
You may reuse the check for <br>another trip, but it is <b>your</b> responsibility to <br>attach it to another flyer.
<p>
<u><b><i>Guests:</b></i></u>
As a KDA member, you may bring<br> a guest with you.  
<u>You and your guest must <br>meet with me in person at least a week <br>before the trip.</u>
 You must be willing to be <br>responsible for your guest?s behavior.  
A <br>member may only take <b>two guests per year</b>, <br>and any certain guest may only participate in <br><b>two KDA trips</b> per year.  
(No guests may be<br> permitted on the overnight trip unless the trip <br>has available space after the deadline.)  
On <br>trips that fill to capacity, guests may be asked<br> to cancel to make room for members.
<p>
<u><b><i>Equipment:</b></i></u>
Likewise, if you are just starting <br>or trying the sport, 
you are not expected to <br>spend a couple hundred dollars on 
equipment <br>for one snow sport event.  
Rental is available<br> either at the resort or from one of our local<br> shops (See about page).
<p>
<u><b><i>Parents/Chaperones:</b></i></u>
Parents are welcome<br> to be a part of KDA activities and are needed <br>to keep trips safe and efficient.  
As participants,<br> parents will be expected to demonstrate moral <br>and ethical character in their words and actions.<br>  
Parents should not use tobacco or alcohol<br> before or during any activity. 
<u>For the activity<br> in which you would like to participate, write a <br>note of intent on the member's trip flyer.</u>
 Cost <br>for parents is the same as members. 
<u>Parents <br>do <b>NOT</b> need to complete the <b>GUEST</b> form.</u>
<p>
<u><b><i>Due Dates for Registration:</b></i></u>
Follow <br>directions on each form. 
<b>Deliver all forms<br> to the KDA Box in either the high school <br>or middle school office.</b> 
 Because of the <br>amount of planning and scheduling required<br> for each trip, the number of participants <br>must be determined in advance.  
Trips will<br> be planned based on the number of forms <br>submitted <b>on time</b>.  
If any space is available, <br>late registrations will be accepted on a first<br> come/first serve basis.  
(You <b><u>must</b></u> deliver <b><u><br>late</b></u> registrations directly to Mr. Brumbaugh.)
