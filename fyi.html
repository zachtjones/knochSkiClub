<u><b><i>After School Trips (Monday-Friday):</b></i></u>
Depart from the high school gym after school. Equipment may be delivered before school (7:00 am - 7:30 am) to the KHS gym or after school to the bus.
<b>Do not deliver equipment to a school office of during the school day.</b> 
Weekend/Day trips will leave and return to the high school parking lot unless otherwise directed.
<p>
<u><b><i>Trip Cancellations:</b></i></u>
If a trip is cancelled, pick up your check in H326 (Mr.Brumbaugh).  
These payments <b>will not</b> be credited to future trips.  
You may reuse the check for another trip, but it is <b>your</b> responsibility to attach it to another flyer.
<p>
<u><b><i>Guests:</b></i></u>
As a KDA member, you may bring a guest with you.  
<u>You and your guest must meet with me in person at least a week before the trip.</u>
 You must be willing to be responsible for your guest?s behavior.  
A member may only take <b>two guests per year</b>, and any certain guest may only participate in <b>two KDA trips</b> per year.  
(No guests may be permitted on the overnight trip unless the trip has available space after the deadline.)  
On trips that fill to capacity, guests may be asked to cancel to make room for members.
<p>
<u><b><i>Equipment:</b></i></u>
Likewise, if you are just starting or trying the sport, 
you are not expected to spend a couple hundred dollars on 
equipment for one snow sport event.  
Rental is available either at the resort or from one of our local shops (See about page).
<p>
<u><b><i>Parents/Chaperones:</b></i></u>
Parents are welcome to be a part of KDA activities and are needed to keep trips safe and efficient.  
As participants, parents will be expected to demonstrate moral and ethical character in their words and actions.  
Parents should not use tobacco or alcohol before or during any activity. 
<u>For the activity in which you would like to participate, write a note of intent on the member's trip flyer.</u>
 Cost for parents is the same as members. 
<u>Parents do <b>NOT</b> need to complete the <b>GUEST</b> form</u>
<p>
<u><b><i>Due Dates for Registration:</b></i></u>
Follow directions on each form. 
<b>Deliver all forms to the KDA Box in either the high school or middle school office.</b> 
 Because of the amount of planning and scheduling required for each trip, the number of participants must be determined in advance.  
Trips will be planned based on the number of forms submitted <b>on time</b>.  
If any space is available, late registrations will be accepted on a first come/first serve basis.  
(You <b><u>must</b></u> deliver <b><u>late</b></u> registrations directly to Mr. Brumbaugh.)
