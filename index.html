            <p><b>KDA, (<i>Knights and Days of Adventure</i>)</b>, was originally started as Knoch Ski Club in 1987 by a student, Scott Gumpto. 
                Through the years, it has grown and diversified to include other adventurous activities such as rafting, camping, caving, and rock climbing.
                In 2004 KDA was adopted as an outreach ministry of Jefferson Center Presbyterian Church. In 2010, KDA became its own non-profit organization with the same goals.
            </p>
            <p>Membership is open to anyone grades 7-12 that lives in the South Butler County School district.</p>

                <blockquote><i>Parents are always welcome and encouraged to participate in KDA activities.</i></blockquote>
            </center>
            <p>Over the years, many people (bus drivers, group sales representatives, parents, and other skiers/boarders) have complimented KDA members for being polite, courteous, responsible, and respectful.
                KDA members have accepted the challenge to have fun <b>without</b> the use of drugs, including alcohol, or tobacco, and treat other people as children of God. </p>

            <h2>The Goals of KDA</h2>
            <big>To Enjoy Life.</big><br><p>
            <blockquote>
                <i>I have come that you may have life - life in all its fullness. (Jesus)<br>John 10:10</i><p>
            </blockquote>
            <big>To recognize the beauty of creation, especially our own health and to enjoy life to its fullness without the impairment of alcohol, drugs, or tobacco.</big><br><p>
            <blockquote>
                <i>Surely you know that you are God's temple and that God's spirit lives in you! So, if anyone destroys God's temple, God will destroy him. 
                    For God's temple is Hold and you yourselves are his temple.<br>1 Corinthians 3:16</i>
            </blockquote>
            <big>To hear the Truth of the Bible.</big><br><p>
            <blockquote>
                <i>All scripture is inspired by God and is useful for teaching the truth, rebuking error, correcting faults, and giving instruction for right living.<br>2 Timothy 3:16</i>
