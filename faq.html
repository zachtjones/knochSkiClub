<u>Who do I contact to answer questions?</u><br>
Mr. Brumbaugh (724) 352-8498, (724) 352-0696, (724) 352-1700 ext. 4326 <a href="mailto:sllkbrum@consolidated.net">sllkbrum@consolidated.net</a> or 
<a href="mailto:brumbaughs@southbutler.net">brumbaughs@southbutler.net</a> <br>
<p>
<u>Do I have to know how to ski or board to join KDA?</u><br>
No, all the resorts that are visited have courteous and professional instructors that will teach you how to safely enjoy the sport correctly. 
As a KDA member your lessons are free. Add all this to the large group of people with you who are also learning, and that equals loads of fun. <br>
<p>
<u>What if I do not have my own equipment?</u><br>
There are rentals available at most resorts as well as Kenmac Rental (Butler) or Peak Ski and Board (Gibsonia). 
KDA members benefit from group rates and discount rentals. 
Beginners and younger members are actually discouraged from buying equipment. 
It is less expensive to rent than to buy and with the changing technology in skis and snowboards, the rental equipment is usually up to date in style and development. 
Both local rental shops do season rentals for those who would like the flexibility of having equipment, but not the cost. <br>
<p>
<u>How much does a trip cost?</u><br>
Prices vary depending on destination, but compared to individual rates, KDA group rates are a huge savings and include the safety of transportation on a charter bus. <br>
<p>
<u>What if I do not know anyone is KDA?</u><br>
This is probably one of the best reasons to join KDA. One of the attributes of the organization is the friendly, welcoming atmosphere of a KDA trip. 
Older/veteran members remember being new/younger and seek out new members to help them and be-friend them. 
Being a part of a KDA trip tends to be more of a small group or camp environment where people get to know each other. <br>
<p>
<u>May I take a guest?</u><br>
Yes! (See FYI for details) <br>
<p>
<u>Can parents attend as chaperones?</u><br>
Yes! (See FYI for details)
