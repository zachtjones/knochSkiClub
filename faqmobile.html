<u>Who do I contact to answer questions?</u><br>
Mr. Brumbaugh (724) 352-8498,<br>
 (724) 352-0696, (724) 352-1700 ext. 4326<br>
<a href="mailto:sllkbrum@consolidated.net">sllkbrum@consolidated.net</a> or 
<br><a href="mailto:brumbaughs@southbutler.net">brumbaughs@southbutler.net</a> <br>
<p>
<u>Do I have to know how to ski or board <br>
to join KDA?</u><br>
No, all the resorts that are visited have<br>
 courteous and professional instructors<br>
 that will teach you how to safely enjoy<br>
 the sport correctly. As a KDA member<br>
 your lessons are free. Add all this to the <br>
large group of people with you who are<br>
 also learning, and that equals loads of fun. <br>
<p>
<u>What if I do not have my own <br>equipment?</u><br>
There are rentals available at most resorts<br>
 as well as Kenmac Rental (Butler) or Peak<br>
 Ski and Board (Gibsonia). KDA members <br>
benefit from group rates and discount <br>
rentals. Beginners and younger members <br>
are actually discouraged from buying <br>
equipment. It is less expensive to rent than <br>
to buy and with the changing technology in <br>
skis and snowboards, the rental equipment<br>
is usually up to date in style and <br>
development. Both local rental shops do<br>
season rentals for those who would like <br>
the flexibility of having equipment, but not <br>
the cost. <br>
<p>
<u>How much does a trip cost?</u><br>
Prices vary depending on destination, but<br>
compared to individual rates, KDA group <br>
rates are a huge savings and include the <br>
safety of transportation on a charter bus. <br>
<p>
<u>What if I do not know anyone is KDA?</u><br>
This is probably one of the best reasons to<br>
join KDA. One of the attributes of the <br>
organization is the friendly, welcoming<br>
atmosphere of a KDA trip. Older/veteran <br>
members remember being new/younger <br>
and seek out new members to help them <br>
and be-friend them. Being a part of a <br>
KDA trip tends to be more of a small <br>
group or camp environment where people<br>
get to know each other. <br>
<p>
<u>May I take a guest?</u><br>
Yes! (See FYI for details) <br>
<p>
<u>Can parents attend as chaperones?</u><br>
Yes! (See FYI for details)
